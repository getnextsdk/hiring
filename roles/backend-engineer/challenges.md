## Option 1 üèÇ Slack Bot Game

## Scope
We want to build a fantastic Slack bot, that plays a simple game between a computer and a Slack user. The rules are simple:

- At the start of each round the computer will calculate a random whole number from `0` - `10`
- The user gets 3 guesses at what number it could be
- If the user guesses incorrectly the bot should respond if it's a `higher` or `lower` number than what was guessed
- After the 3 guesses or if a correct number is correctly guessed a winner should be declared (the user or the bot)

Additional requirements:

- Multiple users should be able to play with the bot simultaneously without it breaking 
- If the server is restarted, the progress of the games should not be destroyed

Example game:

- User: /botgame start
- Computer: Welcome to the Slack Bot Game, try and guess what number I am thinking of between 0 and 10
- User: 5
- Computer: The number I'm thinking of is `higher`
- User: 7
- Computer: Close guess! But the number is `higher`
- User: 9
- Computer: Congratulations! You guessed the number I was thinking of!

You can use any framework or library
